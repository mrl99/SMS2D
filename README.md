I speedrun Super Mario Sunshine (username StrongmanLin on the leaderboards), and I'm interested in game development. So, I thought it might be cool to make a 2D recreation of some of the secret levels, so that is this project's goal. Currently I have most of the basic mechanics done (i.e. jumping, wall sliding, interacting with object), but I have so far only recreated the Bianco 3 secret shine. Due to school I don't have much time to work on it during the year, but this is the product of a the last week of summer, and I plan to continue during Thanksgiving/Winter breaks.

Here's a link to a demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VG0qPmZAsI
